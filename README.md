# TWIN Identity

This repository brings together the core building blocks needed to design and run decentralised identity workflows across different environments. It combines shared models, storage and network connectors, service contracts, a REST client, and a command line tool so teams can implement consistent identity behaviour without rebuilding the same foundation in each project.

Taken together, the workspaces are intended to make identity integrations more predictable from local development through to production operations. The overall structure separates concerns clearly, so applications can evolve their deployment choices while still relying on a stable identity domain model and interoperable interfaces.
